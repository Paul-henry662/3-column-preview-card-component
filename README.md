## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge, I tried to use the grid layout assoiated with flexbox (I think flexbox alone would have done the job, but i really wanted to learn more about how to use grids). I discovered that they are a really powerful association. The card itself is a 3-column grid while each section is a flex container. I simplifies the process a lot.
Also, based on the report on my first challenge solution, I discovered the brand new world of Accessiblity. I placed the whole content in a main tag with ARIA main role.

### Continued development

I'll definetely dig further into accessibility stuff. Also, I'll try to master the grid layout.
